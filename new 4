How to run katalon script from CMD:
Download katalon jar 5.10.1v -> Open cmd and navigate to directory katalon 5.10.1-> generate command from Build CMD from latest version of katalon-> copy the command from katalon and paste it to CMD-> after command SPACE ListenerClassName.groovy
Now it will start running the script from CMD.

Default this is getting import in test class "import com.kms.katalon.core.windows.keyword.WindowsBuiltinKeywords as Windows" for latest katalon, so it will throw error for katalon lower version.
Need to remove this import from class, when we run from CMD.

TC's arer getting failed when we execute script from CMD and only one suit is picking for parallel execution.
We are getting the report in zip folder for parallel  execution from CMD. Still we need to work on this, why TC's are getting failed.

I pasted latest katalon JRE in lower version of katalon, still TC's are getting failed.

try
{
CustomReport.tearDownExtentReports()
}
catch (Throwable e) {
    testLogger.log(Status.FAIL, 'Verification of Account creation in Failed')
	CustomReport.tearDownExtentReports()
}

Listener is required for reporting on PASS/FAIL/ERROR
Actually without listener report is not generating for failed TC's, so we are using listener.
Without listener also we can get the report, but need to put the try{}/catch() block in every classes so it TC fail it will got to catch block and it will print the log.

We are zipping the report on suite level afetr TestSuite.
